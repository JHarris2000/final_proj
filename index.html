        <div class="box8">Hello, My Name is Jason Harris. I am a 19 year old College Student at Michigan State University and I also run my own Ad Management Business I call “Follow The Leader”. 
            First about me, I grew in Southfield and West Bloomfield Michigan. I was an athlete most of my life, playing football and running track. It wasn’t until about the end of my junior year of high school where I started getting into technology. I was thinking of majors for college and computer science to me just sounded like something I would want to do. I finally settled on the school I wanted to attend which was Michigan State University. I made the Dean's List my freshman year and was admitted into the College of Engineering by the end of my sophomore year. When the virus striked and we we’re all forced to quarantine, I stumbled across a new interest. I came very interested in Digital Marketing, specifically for Facebook. I took a course and joined a group full of expert Facebook Advertisers and started picking their brain and learning more about the profession. Now, I feel comfortable enough to start helping businesses from my state bring in more clients and build themselves through Facebook Advertising.

        <div class="box9">Second, the name, The business is called “Follow The Leader” because I work with clients using Facebook ads to bring them in leads, so that they can follow up on them and turn them into paying customers.  It’s a following process all the way from the prospect to the business to be honest. The prospect follows the ad to the owners page, after the prospect puts in their contact information they turn into a lead and then the owner follows them. After the owner follows them, if successful,the lead will follow the owner to the business and become a customer. I got into digital marketing when I was searching Youtube and found out about a guy who started his own digital marketing company. I took his class and joined his group where there are many digital marketing coaches there for me to help me get my own business started. The thing I like about this service is that when everything goes right it’s a win-win for everyone. I get to help someone grow their business and bring them more customers and make them happy. I get to lead people to businesses that can help them with whatever they may be searching for and fulfil their needs, make them happy, and hopefully they can become long term customers. Then I’m happy because I can be the bridge that between the two.
